hello world!!!

this is my 1st project repository on github.
i do not know what i'm doing, i am a noob, and i WOULD apreciate any help you are willing to contribute.
however if you can't be bothered, I get it. :p

This project came about one afternoon while passivlly listening to one of Chris' videos from months ago about WinUtil.
i turened my focus to the video, and skimmed the comments for a bit.
one asking for the option to add a shortcut to the desktop caught my eye.
i began to educate, extrapolate , and describe methods he could do this easily.


then I saw my self in the mirror, stuffing my face with cheatoe, being fat in my network ferret nest.
and it hit me, not like a bolt of lightning, or a flash of inspiration, no.
this was more like the mucus in your nose slowly moving from one side of your nasal cavity to the other; SLOWLY.

i thought " they're not gonna do that, that takes effort" looking in the mirror i continued "and who am i to call the kettle black."

  Then i was sad, because this person was never gonna have the convienience of somthing so simple as a desktop shortcut to launch WinUtil.
I imediatly thought and commented that it would be hilarious if i made the Shortcut, hosted it on Github, and submitted it as a PR on Chris' project. lol
only thing is, i've never used Github before, well not like this, not on the input side.

thing is, the more i thought about how i'd mess it up, and ruffle some peoples feathers in the Dev community,
the funier it got, and i said why not, i got nothing else going on this afternoon.

ROTFL-COPTER :P
